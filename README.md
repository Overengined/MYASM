# MYASM
A small python-driven virtual asm that works on a python-driven virtual disk.  
Inspired by BASIC and LMC.

## Usage
Use `python myasm.py yourprogram.myasm`
You can add a `v` flag at the end if you want a verbose output (kind of a debugging mode).
It would give `python myasm.py yourprogram.myasm v`
